# Matplotlib-Bible
Hey there...Matplotlib is a great way of visualizing data ( Not as great as Bokeh and Tableu) for beginners.
You'll find two python files in the Repo:
* One will show you how to construct various figures using Numerical and Categorical Data.
* Other will show you how to add life to those figures by various customization techniques.

NOTE - Keep the .csv files in the same repository as the .py files
